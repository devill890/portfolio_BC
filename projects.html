                Data Science and Machine Learning are interrelated fields focused on extracting insights from data. Data Science involves analyzing data, identifying patterns, and translating them into meaningful outcomes using statistical analysis and visualization. Machine Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, enables computers to learn and improve without explicit programming, finding applications in image recognition, recommendation systems, and more

                Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for training a new model on a different task.
                In this project, we use transfer learning to build an OCR model for deciphering doctor’s handwriting.

                The model is trained on the IAM Handwriting Database and achieves an accuracy of 87%.
                The trained model is then used to perform OCR on an image of doctor’s handwriting and outputs the result.

                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>

            <code>
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }
            </code>

            <p>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
            </p>

            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code> -->

                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            </p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            <p>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
            </code>
            <p>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
            </p>
            <code>
                if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
            </code>
            <p>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code>
            <p>
                If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
            </p>
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code> -->

            <!-- <p>
                The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                control is passed to the statement following while.
            </p>
            <p>
                To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                those statements.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>
                With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li class="section-list-li">After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li class="section-list-li">After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li class="section-list-li">After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                true, so the loop terminates.

    <!-- <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header class="section-header">Function declarations</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
            </p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li class="section-list-li">The name of the function.</li>
                <li class="section-list-li">
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                    separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li class="section-list-li">
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                    brackets, { }.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>
                The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the value returned by the function.
            </p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>
                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                the calling function.
